# Scrabble-Word-Constructor
In this assignment you will get a chance to use some of the Collection classes and methods we have covered recently. This will enable you to write a faster-running program with less effort than you would otherwise. In this assignment you will also get an opportunity to do your own design; the design outline we provided you is less constrained than in past assignments: you will be deciding on the exact interface and representation for your most of your classes. You'll also get some practice with command-line arguments and text file processing. This assignment concerns the game of Scrabble. You may know the game of Scrabble better as Words with Friends. If you want to try out Words with Friends yourself you can download the free app for your smartphone. However, the programming assignment is not to create the game itself, but to write a console-based program that finds all possible words that can be made from a rack of Scrabble tiles (so it could help someone playing Scrabble). We'll elaborate on the exact requirements of this assignment in the section on the assignment below.

WordFinder.java This class will contain the main method, and any other helper methods that you design. 

AnagramDictionary.java All anagram sets from a dictionary. 

Rack.java Stores the current rack. You can decide on the representation and public methods for this class. 

ScoreTable.java This class has information about how much each scrabble letter is worth. 

IllegalDictionaryException.java A class for reporting an illegal dictionary. 

sowpods.txt The Scrabble dictionary we will be using. The version given here is all lower case letters. Go here for an explanation of its odd name.

testFiles A subdirectory with some data files and corresponding output for help in testing. The README.txt file in that directory explains the files and how to use them.
